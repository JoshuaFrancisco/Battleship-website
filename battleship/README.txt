*NOTE:* 
	Currently a functional Battleship game but unfunctional back-end unless locally hosted on your personal computer

Running Environment:
	-XAMPP for database and local hosting
	-Text Editor of your choice (ex. Notepad++,Sublime) for CSS/HTML/PHP/JavaScript files.

Description: 
	A two team partner project for CSCI 130 made purely for full-stack development by using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. 
	A battleship game website with a database through an open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package (XAMPP) 
	using an Apache HTTP Server and with an open source administration tool MariaDB.

How to:
	To run these files XAMPP must de installed on your personal computer. You can find a downloadable version of XAMPP here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html 
	These files can also be accessed through any web browser but are not hosted 24/7.  With the battleship folder drag and drop your files into 
	htdocs (File path: D:\XAMPP\htdocs\battleship). On the XAMPP Control Panel Start the Apache and MySQL services to run the server and allow for a connection to the 		database. In the battleship/database a sql folder consisting of the database of player accounts can be found. Import this into your databse on phpMyAdmin. Once imported 	 back-end access is enabled. At this point everything should be working. To access the website directly, in your web browser address type in: 
	localhost/battleship/index.php. You should be able to see the landing page of the website and access every feature of the website from the howto, game, about, 
	login and register pages.
